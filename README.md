# Cryptio Technical Interview

This is my take on the cryptio technical interview shocasing my first contact with react / typescript

## Installation

This is just a prototype so a front and back install is required

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

By starting the front you will be able to check the historical transactions of a bitcoin address as well as its balance at the time 

```bash
cd front
npm start
```
